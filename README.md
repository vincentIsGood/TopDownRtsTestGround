# Inspiration
1. Company of Heroes but Top-down 2D
2. Endless war 7 (https://www.kongregate.com/games/Vitaly/endless-war-7)

## Purpose
This serves as a test ground for various rts concepts but in top-down form.

## Warning
This project currently (partially) mirrors my private university school project called **Steel And Magic**. I will make sure only my (mainly) **code** contribution will be mirrored.

As such, compilation errors will not happen, but some component configurations will be missing or be left in the old state. Changes will be made after the school project is done.
